      "each operated site subject to these risks, based on incident scenarios for\n",
      "which the probability of occurrence and the severity of the consequences\n",

      "reduce the consequences (mitigation and prevention). They are technical\n",
      "and organizational. These analyses are updated periodically, at least every\n",
      "five years, or when facilities are modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the design and construction of facilities, technical\n",
